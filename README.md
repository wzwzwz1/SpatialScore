# SpatialScore: Towards Unified Evaluation for Multimodal Spatial Understanding (CVPR 2026)
11
This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation of SpatialScore: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17012/.

Our new version paper has been accepted by CVPR 2026, and we are working on updating our up-to-date code and data!
Please stay tuned! Feel free to reach out for discussions!

## Some Information
[Project Page](https://haoningwu3639.github.io/SpatialScore/) $\cdot$ [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17012/) $\cdot$ [Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/haoningwu/SpatialScore)

## News
- [2026.4] Glad to share that **SpatialScore** has been accepted to **CVPR 2026** and selected as **Highlight**.
- [2025.5] We have released version_0 of our evaluation code, supporting most mainstream models.
- [2025.5] We have released version_0 of SpatialScore, which is available on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/haoningwu/SpatialScore).
- [2025.5] Our pre-print paper is released on arXiv.

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.10 (Recommend to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html))
- [PyTorch >= 2.5.1](https://pytorch.org/)
- accelerate == 1.5.2
- triton == 3.2.0
- transformers == 4.51.3 (4.49.0 is recommended for Cambrian, SpaceLLaVA, and SpatialBot models)

A suitable [conda](https://conda.io/) environment named `SpatialScore` can be created and activated with:

```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate SpatialScore
```

## Dataset
Please check out [SpaitalScore](https://huggingface.co/datasets/haoningwu/SpatialScore) to download our proposed benchmark (`SpatialScore`).

If you cannot access Huggingface, you can use [hf-mirror](https://hf-mirror.com/) to download models.

```
export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com # Add this before huggingface-cli download
```

You can follow the commands below to prepare the data:

```
huggingface-cli download --resume-download --repo-type dataset haoningwu/SpatialScore --local-dir ./ --local-dir-use-symlinks False
unzip SpatialScore.zip
```

## Evaluation

To be updated soon...

Considering the current mainstream model architectures, we have prioritized support for the Qwen2.5VL and InternVL series models. 
You can evaluate them on SpatialScore using the following commands:

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python test_qwen.py --model_name qwen2_5vl-7b --model_path ./huggingface/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct --dataset_json_path ./dataset/SpatialScore.json --dataset_name all --output_dir ./eval_results

CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python test_qwen.py --model_name internvl3-8b --model_path ./huggingface/InternVL3-8B --dataset_json_path ./dataset/SpatialScore.json --dataset_name all --output_dir ./eval_results
```

Now, the All-in-one script supporting all other models is also available.
You can evaluate other models on SpatialScore using the following commands:

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python test_qwen.py --model_name llava-ov-7b --model_path ./huggingface/LLaVA-OneVision-7B --dataset_json_path ./dataset/SpatialScore.json --dataset_name all --output_dir ./eval_results
```

## Inference with SpatialAgent
We have initialized some basic codes of our SpatialAgent, for example, the expert tools we adopt.
And we will update the agent system and inference code soon.

To be updated soon...

## LangGraph SpatialAgent (new package)

A new independent package now exists at [`spatial_agent/`](./spatial_agent) for a LangGraph-based **ReAct-only** SpatialAgent implementation. It does not modify the old `version_0/SpatialAgent` AutoGen control flow.

Highlights:

- ReAct state graph built with LangGraph
- model adapter abstraction
- default local HuggingFace Qwen VL adapter
- OpenAI-compatible API adapter
- centralized tool registry with structured `ToolResult`
- per-run JSON traces under `.artifacts/spatial_agent/`
- same-host `lmms-eval` plugin for VSI-Bench evaluation

Quick start:

```bash
python3 -m spatial_agent \
  --question "Which option is correct?" \
  --question-type multi_choice \
  --input-modality single_image \
  --options A,B,C,D \
  --image-path /path/to/image.jpg \
  --llm-backend hf \
  --model-path /path/to/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct
```

See [`spatial_agent/README.md`](./spatial_agent/README.md) for current tool availability and runtime limitations.
For the same-host `VSI-Bench` workflow, see [`docs/spatial_agent_vsibench.md`](./docs/spatial_agent_vsibench.md).
